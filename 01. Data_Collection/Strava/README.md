### Data Collection for Strava

Due to the terms of use for Strava Data, we are unable to share the raw Strava trajectories.  We are however, able to share the identifiers (IDs) of the Strava Activities that were used in our analysis.  These IDs are stored in the file `strava_activity_ids.csv`. These can be 're-hydrated' (to use an old Twitter API term) to get the full JSON activity files using the PHP script `getStravaActivity_AGILE.php`.  Note that the reqests to strava.com are 'rate limited' to a maximum of 300 requests per hour.  In order to collect the ~10000 activities that were used in our analysis, it would take roughly 33 hours.
