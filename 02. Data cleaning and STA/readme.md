After downloading the dataset, extract all data files into the same folder as your code to ensure proper execution. Put the 'Roadway_Block.shp' inside as well. For example, place all 12 Capital Bikeshare CSV files and 'Roadway_Block.shp' in the folder containing Jupyternotebook '2.1.Capital Bikeshare_data cleaning and STA.ipynb'

Here are the scripts for cleaning and doing STA analysis for these four datasets. Please run codes in order, as you will need the former file in later code, especially for LIME data.
