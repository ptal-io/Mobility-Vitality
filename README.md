 Here are the scripts for the Mobility Vitality paper. This repository contains all the data collection and analysis in the paper. Please run the coding files in order, as you will need the former file in the latter code.

 We run all the code on Google Colab with the hardware accelerator of v2-8 TPU. If you are going to run on your own laptop, please install a conda environment.

 This paper is accepted for the Agile 2025 conference.
