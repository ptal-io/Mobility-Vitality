Here are the scripts for creating all other figures except Figure 5. Because you had Figure 5 for STA in the second step. Please run coding files in order, as you will need the former file in later code.

For Figure 3, the reference map of Washington, D.C, please download the shapefile here: https://github.com/zocoi/zillow_neighborhoods. Then use ArcGIS Pro to display the labels of the neighborhoods' names.
